# odin-recipes
Odin-recipes is built to demonstrate some basic concepts in HTML. The website will demonstrate the use of concepts learned in the previous HTML lessons including:

tags
    -html
    -head
    -meta
    -title
    -body
    -paragraph (p)
    -heading (h1,h2,...)
    -image (img)
    -unordered list (ul)
    -ordered list (ol)
    -anchor (a)

attributes
    -language (lang)
    -charachter set (charset)
    -source (src)
    -alternative text (alt)
    -hyperlink reference (href)

Also, this project is hosted on GitHub. This allows the project to demonstrate some basic git functionality such as:

git
    -create a repository
    -use git workflow to commit, push, and commit messages
    -use git workflow to check statuses and log histories

This project requires the use of the command line. Here are some basics covered:
    
command line 
    -make diretory (mkdir)
    -changing directory (cd)
    -create new file (touch)
    -move or copy file (mv)
    -present working directory (pwd)
    -remove (rm)
    -list contents (ls)
    -tab completion

The goal of this project is to combine the above topics to create a functioning recipe website that has three websites total to help with practice HTML, git, and the command line.
