    <h2>Description</h2>
    </p>

    <p>
        I think I'm a genius for this one. No longer will vegetarians have to submit to Tofurky or mock meats. Just
        stuff a squash with amazing buttery bread and herbs and roast and serve with thick vegetable-based gravy, and
        you'll be the hottest vegetarian dinner host ever in the whole universe. I'm sure some veggie people have done
        this. If not, here ya go, you absolute freaks.

    <h3>Cooking Instructions</h3>
    </p>

    <p>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the “poultry” seasoning: Combine all the ingredients in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>Make the stuffed squash: In a large saucepan, melt 2 pounds (900 g) of the butter over medium-high heat.
        </li>
        <li>Add the onions and celery, reduce heat to medium-low, and gently sweat for 20 minutes, or until the
            vegetables are translucent.</li>
        <li>Add 1/3 cup (50 g) of the “poultry” seasoning and toast until fragrant, about 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the grated squash and chestnuts and stir until completely coated; cook for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add 4 cups (900 ml) of the court bouillon, bring to a simmer, and mix in the sourdough pieces. The mixture
            should be slightly wet.</li>
        <li>Add the parsley and salt and remove from heat.</li>
        <li>With one squash half, cut off about 2 inches (5 cm) from the bulbous end to create a vent.</li>
        <li>Stuff the other hollowed-out squash half with the stuffing; pack it in with the stuffing crowning out of the
            squash by about 3/4 inch (2 cm).</li>
        <li>Place the piece with the end cut off on top of the stuffed bottom and tie with butcher's twine. (If you have
            no idea what I'm saying, flip to this page for a picture of how the vent should look.) Once securely tied,
            make sure that the stuffing is packed evenly into the squash.</li>
        <li>Now melt the remaining 1/3 cup (40 g) butter into the remaining 2 1/2 cups (600 ml) court bouillon for
            basting.</li>
        <li>Place the whole squash onto a rack set in a baking sheet. Bake for about 1 hour, basting the squash with the
            court bouillon and butter mixture every 15 minutes, until the stuffing is golden brown and the whole squash
            is fork-tender.</li>
        <li>Make the vegetable gravy: As the squash is cooking, melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat.
        </li>
        <li>Add the flour, stir until the flour is fully incorporated into the butter, and cook until it starts to
            bubble and turn golden in color, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Slowly pour in half the celeriac stock and blend with an immersion blender until thick.</li>
        <li>Add the rest of the celeriac stock, the “poultry” seasoning, and salt and cook for 10 minutes over
            medium-low heat.</li>
        <li>Blend again and check for seasoning. Keep warm until plating.</li>
        <li>Slice the whole squash into 1-inch (2.5 cm) rounds and place on a serving platter; cover with vegetable
            gravy or serve gravy on the side.</li>
    </ol>
